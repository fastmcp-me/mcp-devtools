### Using Tools

Once configured, you can interact with tools through natural language commands in Cursor.

#### Jira Examples:

```
# Fetch a specific ticket
get ticket SCRUM-123

# Search for tickets
execute jql "project = SCRUM AND status = 'In Progress'"

# Get ticket details
read ticket SCRUM-123

# Create a new ticket
create ticket project=SCRUM summary="Fix login bug" description="Users can't log in" issuetype=Bug
```

#### Linear Examples:

```
# Get a specific issue
get_issue SS-33

# Search for issues
search_issues "priority is high" with limit 5

# Create a new issue
create_issue for team "eng" titled "Fix API response format" with description "The API is returning incorrect data format" and priority 1

# List teams
list_teams
```

For a complete list of available commands, refer to the package documentation:

- [Jira Package Documentation](./packages/jira/README.md)
- [Linear Package Documentation](./packages/linear/README.md)

## Development

### Getting Started

This repository uses pnpm workspaces for package management. To get started:

1. Install pnpm if you don't have it:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build all packages:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

### Development Workflow

For development with auto-rebuild:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Publishing to NPM

This repository is set up with automated release management using release-please and GitHub Actions for publishing packages to npmjs.org.

#### Beta Status

All published packages are currently in beta status (0.x.x versions) and use the `beta` npm tag. During this phase:

- Breaking changes may occur in minor version updates
- Install the packages using: `npm install @mcp-devtools/package-name@beta`
- When the project reaches stability, we will release version 1.0.0

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a workspace script:

```bash
pnpm inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.

## Contributing

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)

### Conventional Commits

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to automate versioning and changelog generation. Please format your commit messages following this pattern:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect the code's meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:

```
feat(jira): add comment creation endpoint
fix(http-client): resolve timeout issue
docs: update README with new setup instructions
```

Breaking changes should be indicated by adding an exclamation mark after the type/scope and describing the breaking change in the body of the commit message:

```
feat!: redesign http-client API

BREAKING CHANGE: The http-client API has been completely redesigned to improve usability.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Problems**

   - Ensure your API credentials are correct
   - Check network connectivity to your service instances
   - Verify URLs and workspace names

2. **Permission Errors**

   - Ensure your accounts have appropriate permissions for the actions you're attempting
   - API tokens may need specific permissions enabled in your account settings

3. **Command Not Found**
   - If using npx, ensure you're connected to npm registry
   - For local installations, check that your package installation was successful

For more troubleshooting help, open an issue on our GitHub repository.

## Roadmap

Future development plans for MCP DevTools include:

- Additional service integrations (GitHub, Confluence, etc.)
- Enhanced security features
- Support for custom authentication methods
- Expanded querying capabilities
- Performance optimizations

## Community and Support
